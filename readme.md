# Programming Language Roulette -> TypeScript

Project name: Rank

I've been task to build something using Typescript. My goal is to produce a small cli whose purpose is to rank GitHub user.
I've choose to go with [Deno](https://deno.com/) (/ˈdiːnoʊ/, pronounced dee-no).
It's a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime based on Rust.

## Setup

To install Deno:

```sh
brew install deno
```

## Usage

To run the program:

```
deno task dev username1 username2 -> Fetch the users data from github api, and rank them
```
